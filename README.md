# Interactive Political Districting Visualization for Portugal using D3.js

Welcome to the **Interactive Political Districting Visualization** project for Portugal! This repository contains a D3.js-based interactive map that visualizes the results of a political districting algorithm applied to Portugal's regions. This visualization aims to provide insights into the distribution of districts and how they've been allocated across the country.
